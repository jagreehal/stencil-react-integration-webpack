# Integrating Stencil components into React apps

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/jagreehal/stencil-react-integration-webpack.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is an example of how to integrate [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) components into [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps that use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).


## To try it out 

This example works by 'linking' the stencil-components library to the react app. You can do this your self, or just use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

``` bash
yarn
```

then 

``` bash
yarn start
```
